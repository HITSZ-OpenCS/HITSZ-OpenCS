# 基本逻辑门

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. A logic gate is a electronic circuit having one or more than one *input port(s)* and only one *output port*. The relationship between its input(s) and output is determined by a certain logic. 

It’s necessary to memorise the function, symbol as well as algebraic expression of some common logic gates introduced in this chapter.

# Basic Operations

## AND Gate

The AND gate only outputs a positive signal when all of its inputs are getting positive signal.

Expression: $F=A\cdot B=AB$. Intuitively the AND logic can be treated as multiplication.

## OR Gate

The OR gate only outputs a negative signal when all of its inputs are getting negative signal.

Expression: $F=A+B$. Intuitively the OR logic can be treated as addition.

## NOT Gate

The NOT gate will produce a signal different from its input.

Expression: $F=\bar{A}=A'$.

# Other Operations

## NAND Gate

NAND = NOT + AND, i.e. $F=\overline{AB}$.

Symbol:

## NOR Gate

NOR = NOT + OR, i.e. $F=\overline{A+B}$.

Symbol:

## AND-OR-NOT Gate

**This is not a common logic gate**.

This kind of logic gate has 4 input ports, wiring them with AND gate two by two and then connects the two outputs with a NOR gate.

Expression: $F=\overline{AB+CD}$.

Symbol:

The fact is, I hold the opinion that this is not a logic gate. It’s a kind of combinational logic block.

## XOR Gate

Exclusive OR gate, or XOR gate, outputs a positive signal only when its two input signals are different from each other.

Expression: $F=A\oplus B=\bar{A}B+A\bar{B}$.

Symbol:

## XNOR Gate

XNOR = NOT + XOR, i.e. $F=AB+\bar{A}\bar{B}$.

XNOR gate outputs a positive signal only when its two input signals are the same one.
